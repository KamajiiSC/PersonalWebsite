      My name is Brandon. I am from Baltimore Maryland and have lived here my whole life. Since I was young there's always been an intrigue in technology and the possibilities. I built my first computer when I was five with the help of my father. Ever since then I've had a knack for figuring things out and problem solving. Middle school is when I began programming for fun. I've jumped around a lot and have dabbled with many different languages trying different projects, from computer games to mobile apps I always want to learn more. It wasn't until I stumbled across html and css that I found a passion. Web technologies have become extremely fascinating for me over the past 2 years and I learn new things everyday. Javascript has been a major focus for me, it's so different than most high level languages and is so nuanced that I never run out of things to learn about. From prototypal inheritance to being single threaded but also asynchronous, the language never makes for a dull moment, not to mention all of the libraries out there.
